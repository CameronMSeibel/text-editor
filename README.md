## Installation

The webpage can be visited [here](https://cmseibel-text-editor.herokuapp.com/). Once there, you can install the app by clicking the install button on the top left of the page.

## Usage

Simply type to take notes. Notes will persist and be available even if you close the page. JATE supports JavaScript syntax, so it is an ideal place to take notes for web development.
